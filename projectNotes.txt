QSettings class in Qt: This class is used to  read/write .conf files in linux/embedded systems 
What does QSettings class does?

    Stores the key-value pairs in Configuration files Configuration files.
    Is platform independent:
    1) Linux/macOS: .conf files (INI style)
    2) Windows: Registry
    
   Main functions :  QSettings *settings = new QSettings(filepath)
                     settings->begingroup()
                     read/write operations 
                     settings->endgroup()
                     
                     
Note: ConfigParser class has been made as Singleton class because it will be shared amongst many modules and the same object has to be shared.

So, I have implemented a singleton-based COnfigparser using QSettings. This ensured centralized runtime configuration without code duplication. The singleton instance was accessible from anywhere, suppoorting a clean and testable architecture
